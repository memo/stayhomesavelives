# STAY HOME SAVE LIVES

A quick demonstration of the impact of **exponential growth**, and in the case of an epidemic such as #COVID19, how a single individual can quickly be responsible for the infection of thousands - if not tens or hundreds of thousands - of other people.

So a single individual deciding to **stay home** and not get infected, can prevent many others from getting infected, and save many lives.

DISCLAIMER: This is not a **simulation**. It is a vastly simplified **Data Dramatization** of how **Staying Home Saves Lives**.
